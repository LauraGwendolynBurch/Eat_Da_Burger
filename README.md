# Eat_Da_Burger
## Description
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users order the burger they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger in the middle of the page waiting to be picked up. Each burger in the waiting area have a pickup button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. There they can click a button that throws the finished burger into the trash. This app stores every burger in the database until it is thrown away.
